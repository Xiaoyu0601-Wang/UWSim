# [WIP] UWSim
Underwater Simulator (UWSim) running with ROS2 in Ubuntu22.04
I started this repository to develop a new version of UWSim that runs with ROS2 in Ubuntu22.04. I'm thinking about using OpenSceneGraph (OSG) or VulkanSceneGraph (VSG). OSG has an oceanlib for real-time rendering. However, OSG is out of date. On the other hand, the newest one is VSG which is better than OSG but is still under development. And I'm still not sure how to realize real-time ocean rendering with VSG. So far, everything is still under planning.
